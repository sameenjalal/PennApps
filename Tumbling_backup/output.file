<ul><li>Get abs back</li>
<li>Make money</li>
<li>Learn Scheme</li>
<li>Learn shell programming</li>
</ul><p>During August, I was extremely occupied with my two jobs, so my only accomplished goal was making money. I spent the rest of my time watching TV or iChatting (hey, Joanna :P).</p>
<p>Not the most productive month, but it was good to have a break from academia after everything I taught myself and worked on in the prior months.</p>
<p>For anyone who cares, this was my summer reading list:</p>
<ol><li>Head First PHP &amp; MySQL</li>
<li>Head First JavaScript</li>
<li>JavaScript: The Good Parts</li>
<li>The Hunger Games (Hey, Joanna! :P)</li>
<li>The Art of SEO</li>
<li>Beginning C++ Through Game Programming</li>
<li>Absolute C++</li>
<li>Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python</li>
</ol><p>I&#8217;m currently reading Catching Fire (hey, Joanna! :P), which I&#8217;m hoping to finish soon.</p>
<p>Also, my shoulder is still in pain. I&#8217;ve been slacking on my physical therapy x_x</p>
<p>Good night, Tumblr.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My idols arenât perfect. They all arenât the usual idols because of some type of bravery or charcter strength, but rather for this specific quality they have in them that I want in myself. Some of them may be superficial, and some may be the typicalÂ  definition of whatÂ people would think of anÂ âidolâ. Either way, they all played a part in shaping who I am (as clichÃ© as it may sound). For privacy reasons, some will be anonymous.</p>
<p><br/>Idol 1: A friendâs sister. IÂ might as well get throughÂ my most superificial idol first. She was my ideal body I wanted to have, and what I wouldÂ motivation wasÂ when I wanted to lose weight last year. Not soo skinny, and not too big either. Just right.</p>
<p>Idol 2: @grardb. Iâm not gonna lie bro, you are one mothereffing intellectual jigga and your sense of humor is effing hilarious. Your views on things are extremely insightful, and I wish I could be as culturally intellectual as you. Iâm kinda sad I didnât get to talk to you as much during HS &gt;.&lt;.</p>
<p>Idol 3: @nkcp. I really wish I had your sense of responsibility and down to earth minded-ness and simplicity. I suck at it. Period.</p>
<p>Idol 4: Chef Kevin Collins. My culinary teacher during my senior year of HS. By being one of the greatest teachers Iâve ever had, and being so âI donât give an effâ type of attitude with me, heâs the one who convinced me that I do belong in the culinary arts and what doors it could open in my life.</p>
<p>Idol 5: @nopreshyr. Your motivation and determination reallyÂ astounds me. If IÂ had to go through what you did, and what youâreÂ doing now, I donât think Iâd be able to handle it. You are really commendable. Keep it up. Iâm here if you ever need me.</p>
<p>Idol 6: My RAPS kuya, @onyourmark. You really motivate me to learn languages just because you can speak French fluently, which was what I wanted to do since the end of eigth grade. Itâs still my life goal to learn at least 5 languages.</p>
<p>Idol 7: I donât know if you would call her an idol, but sheâs definately on my top 10 most influential people in my life, Mrs. Rampersaud. When I transferred to her freshman bio class after I think 3 weeks of HS because I wanted more of a challenge than what my current teacher was giving, she scared the crap out of me. She yelled at me because I didnât give her theÂ note I had to give from her to Ms. VillaruelÂ back (which I didnât know I had to do). Ever since then, sheâs been a hard ass. She was one of the best teachers Iâve ever had because she taught like we were adults. She wasnât easy on us because we were freshman. She gave us the most homework, the hardest tests, and always asked us questions on the spot about material just because she could tell we didnât know it -_-. But because of her, I was taught how to study. I really donât think I couldâve survived college without what she taught me. So thank you for being such a hard butt.</p>
<p>Idol 8:Â My last idols. As typical as it is going to sound, they are my parents. My dad specifically for his oustanding patience and how he never complains about doing something. He just does it even if it is extremely inconvenient for him or he doesnât want to do it. He never says anything at all. Thank you for teachingÂ the virtue of patience and howÂ pushovers and aggressives donât come out first. My mom, for what she has endured and what sheâsÂ enduring now.Â I canât say everything because of privacy, butÂ she really has taught me perseverance in the face of pain and devestation. Thank you for bringing me into life along with daddy.</p>
<p>Anyways, if you readÂ this, thank you for reading all of my sappyness. I hope youÂ gotÂ an insightÂ to a part ofÂ what I am =DÂ </p>

<p>After that, you go on to show your lack of proofreading ability by omitting the &#8216;s&#8217; in &#8220;news.&#8221; That&#8217;s quite ironic, assuming that you&#8217;re trying to call me an idiot.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m not sure who this is. I&#8217;ve disabled the option for anonymous users to ask me questions because I&#8217;m not one to get into drama, especially on the internet. If you really have a problem with me, then please contact me elsewhere and refrain from being anonymous.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re all adults; I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a more mature way to resolve whatever issues you have with me. Being tough on the internet isn&#8217;t the way to do it.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>
